# TeensyKociemba

This is a straighforward adaptation of Kociemba's Rubik's cube solving algorithm for Teensy 4.1.

This port consumes 4.3MB of flash memory on the Teensy (and optionally up to 700KB of RAM). Solve a randomly scrambled cube with less than 24 moves under 1 second in average. 

- The code was hacked from https://github.com/muodov/kociemba. 

- Check H. Kociemba's webpage http://kociemba.org/ for explanations about his beautiful algorithm.
